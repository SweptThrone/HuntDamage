# Hunt Damage
Various damage types and system used in Hunt: Showdown recreated in Garry's Mod.  
⚠️ This addon was never finished and was not tested enough.  I'm releasing it anyway with some notices.  

## What is this?
Hunt Damage recreates the damage types and effects (bleeding, poison, burning) from Hunt: Showdown in Garry's Mod.  It also provides functions for developers to make their own things that inflict these effects.  

## How do I use it?
Drop the HuntDamage_addon folder into your addons folder.  Connecting clients will need the 196 KB sound/huntdmg/bandageloop.wav file.  

## Important notices
This addon was not tested enough, may be missing features, and may not be terribly efficient.  You're encouraged to contribute and/or report issues.  
If a player has armor and starts bleeding or burning, this addon will near-instantly shred all of their armor.  I didn't know how I wanted to handle this, so I didn't.
